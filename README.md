This repository contains my first 5 projects that I made from scratch. This is the beginning of my career. I created a calculator for the future age in 35 years, a mini questionnaire that asks for name and age, a program that asks for any number and the program determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. I also created a console output and a program that asks for your age and determines whether you are an adult or not. If you are not, it displays how many years you have left until you turn 18. I spent 3-4 hours on these projects. To run the project, you need to: 1. Copy the code and paste it into the Python interpreter. 2. Press enter or F5. 3. See the result
